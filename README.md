# Reinforcemnent Learning - Holiday Assigment 

## Repository Contents

* Implement Upper-Confience bound algorithm (UCB) in Multi Arm Banding Problem to optimize player rewards in a basic game simulation with Python Program.

* Imagine an IoT-based smart home system that dynamically optimizes energy usage across multiple devices (e.g., air conditioner, heater, and lights). Each device has a varying energy consumption efficiency based on real-time environmental factors like temperature or occupancy. Design an UCB algorithm is used to determine which device settings (e.g., energy modes) should be prioritized to maximize energy efficiency and implement the algorithm in Python
  
* Develop a Chess-like game using PAC(Probably approximately correct) algorithm where the Problem set-up is as follows:

  * Problem Setup

      i) Game Environment: Simplify chess to a smaller grid with basic pieces (like pawns and a king).

      ii) PAC Learning: Train a model to approximate a move policy that is "probably approximately correct" (i.e., likely correct within some error bounds).

  * Implementation Goals: Use supervised learning to traina model with a dataset of board states and corresponding optimal moves.

  * Implementation:

    1. The chess-like game will have a simplified 4x4 board with only a king and a few pawns.

    2. PAC learning will train a simple classifier (e.g., decision tree) to predict moves.
